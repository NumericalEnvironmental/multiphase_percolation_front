# multiphase_percolation_front

![Preview](https://numericalenvironmental.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/utchem-comparison.jpg?w=616)

A scilab script that models 1-D gravity-driven multiphase flow/percolation; a Monte Carlo version is also included. Both scripts are self-contained (i.e., no external input files used).

napl_percolation.sce: a scilab script to simulate multiphase percolation in the absence of capillary forces (i.e. gravity-driven)
napl_monte_carlo.sce: a variation on the above, designed to run a number of scenarios to explore solution space

I'd appreciate hearing back from you if you find the script useful. Questions or comments are welcome at walt.mcnab@gmail.com.
