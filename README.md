# multiphase_percolation_front
A scilab script that models 1-D gravity-driven multiphase flow/percolation; a Monte Carlo version is also included. Both scripts are self-contained (i.e., no external input files used).

napl_percolation.sce: a scilab script to simulate multiphase percolation in the absence of capillary forces (i.e. gravity-driven)
napl_monte_carlo.sce: a variation on the above, designed to run a number of scenarios to explore solution space
